# Paws Connect: Admin Portal Features

This document describes the features of the Paws Connect Admin Portal, a web-based tool for administrators to manage the platform, moderate content, and gain insights into community health.

## 1. Dashboard & Insights

- **Overview:** The main dashboard will provide a high-level overview of the platform's activity.
- **Key Metrics:**
  - **User Growth:** New users, daily/monthly active users.
  - **Engagement:** Posts per day, likes, comments, user session duration.
  - **Content Health:** Number of moderated posts, common flag categories.
- **AI-Driven Insights:** The dashboard will feature an "Insights" section that uses AI to identify trends, such as popular pet breeds, trending topics, and emerging communities within the app.

## 2. AI-Assisted Content Moderation

- **Moderation Queue:** A centralized queue of all content (posts, comments, user profiles) that has been flagged either by users or by the AI moderation system.
- **AI Pre-Scoring:** Each item in the queue will be pre-scored by the AI with a confidence level for a specific violation (e.g., "95% confidence for hate speech"). This allows admins to prioritize the most critical cases.
- **Workflow:**
  1. Admin selects a flagged item.
  2. The content is displayed with the reason for the flag and the AI's analysis.
  3. Admin can take action: "Dismiss", "Hide Content", "Suspend User".
  4. This feedback is logged to help retrain and improve the moderation AI over time.

## 3. Automated Alerts

- **Real-time Notifications:** The system will generate automated alerts for high-priority issues that require immediate attention.
- **Alert Triggers:**
  - **High-Confidence Flags:** Content flagged by the AI with a very high confidence score (e.g., >99%) for severe violations.
  - **Suspicious Activity:** Rapid spikes in user reports, coordinated spam attacks, or unusual user registration patterns.
  - **System Health:** Alerts related to API errors or other system-level problems.
- **Delivery:** Alerts will be sent to a dedicated admin channel (e.g., a Slack channel or a specific email address).

## 4. User Management

- **User Directory:** A searchable and filterable list of all registered users.
- **Admin Actions:** From the user list, admins can:
  - View a user's full profile and activity history.
  - Manually suspend or unsuspend a user account.
  - Reset a user's password or other account details.
  - Assign roles (e.g., promote a user to a community moderator role).
