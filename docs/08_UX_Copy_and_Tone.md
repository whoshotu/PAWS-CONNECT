# Paws Connect: UX Copy and Tone of Voice

This document provides guidelines for the tone of voice and writing style to be used across the Paws Connect app and all related communications.

## Our Tone of Voice

The Paws Connect tone of voice should be:

- **Friendly & Welcoming:** We want our users to feel like they are part of a supportive community. Our language should be warm, approachable, and inclusive.
- **Helpful & Reassuring:** As a platform for pet parents, we should be a source of trusted information and support. Our copy should be clear, encouraging, and empathetic.
- **Conversational & Playful:** We can be playful and use pet-related puns where appropriate, but we should avoid being overly silly or unprofessional. The language should feel natural and human.

## Guiding Principles

- **Use "You" and "We":** Address the user directly to create a personal connection.
- **Keep it Simple:** Avoid jargon and technical terms. Use short sentences and clear language.
- **Be Positive:** Frame messages in a positive and encouraging way.
- **Show Empathy:** Acknowledge the user's feelings and needs, especially when dealing with sensitive topics like pet health.

## Examples

### Onboarding
- "Welcome to Paws Connect! Let's get you and your furry friends set up."
- "Tell us a little about your pet. What makes them special?"

### AI Features
- "Your post looks great! Would you like me to suggest a caption?"
- (For recommendations) "Here are some parks we think you and [Pet's Name] will love!"
- (PawsBot) "Hi, I'm PawsBot! Ask me anything about pet care, or I can help you find a vet near you."

### Error Messages
- "Oops! We can't seem to find that page. Let's get you back on track."
- "There was a problem uploading your photo. Please try again in a moment."

### Notifications
