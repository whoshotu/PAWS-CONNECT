# Paws Connect: DevOps and Deployment Plan

This document outlines the DevOps strategy and deployment pipeline for the Paws Connect platform.

## 1. CI/CD Pipeline

- **Source Control:** All code will be hosted in a monorepo on GitHub.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** We will use GitHub Actions for our CI pipeline. Every pull request will trigger a workflow that:
  - Installs dependencies.
  - Runs linting and static analysis checks.
  - Executes unit and integration tests.
  - Builds the applications (web, mobile, backend).
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Upon merging to the `main` branch, the CD pipeline will be triggered:
  - **Frontend (Web):** The Next.js application will be automatically deployed to Vercel.
  - **Backend & AI Services:** Docker images will be built for the NestJS backend and the Python AI service. These images will be pushed to AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry) and then deployed to AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service).

## 2. Environment Strategy

We will maintain three primary environments:

- **Development (`dev`):** Deployed automatically from the `develop` branch. This environment will be used by the development team for testing new features.
- **Staging (`staging`):** Deployed automatically from the `staging` branch (or manually promoted from `dev`). This environment will be a mirror of production and will be used for final testing and QA before a release.
- **Production (`main`):** Deployed automatically from the `main` branch. This is the live environment for our users.

## 3. AI Microservice Management

- **Containerization:** The Python (FastAPI) AI service will be containerized using Docker. This ensures consistency across environments and simplifies deployment.
- **Model Versioning:** AI models will be versioned and stored in an AWS S3 bucket. The AI service will be configured to load a specific model version, which will allow us to easily roll back to a previous model if needed.
- **Scalability:** The AI service will be deployed on AWS ECS with auto-scaling configured to handle fluctuations in demand.

## 4. Logging and Monitoring

- **Centralized Logging:** All services (backend, frontend, AI) will send logs to a centralized logging platform like Datadog. This will allow us to easily search and analyze logs from across the entire system.
- **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):** We will use Sentry for real-time error tracking and performance monitoring in our frontend and backend applications.
- **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Datadog will be used to monitor the health and performance of our AWS infrastructure (ECS, RDS, etc.).
- **Alerting:** We will configure alerts in Datadog and Sentry to notify the team of critical errors, performance issues, or security threats.
